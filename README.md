- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SDLangshaw
I am working on a new project, blockchain based real world assets.
Here is where we are so far in building the dApp and connecting to our smart contract code:

We have written smart contracts with the help of AI, specifically, ChatGPT4.

We started og the dApp and have writted code also with the hel of AI.

There are 4 repositories. The fe-reitdapp repo is our skeleton UI is unstructured, built using next.js

The ui-reitdapp repo is an attempt to hire a dev to finish the coding our dApp.

The be-reitdapp repo is not used, but I suspect this is where we will house our smart contract code.

As of 07-05-2023 I am in the process of structuring the dApp to comply with structure Context API and a Management Library (Redux, Redux-toolkit). 

Our project is simple, provide a secure platform to connect asset owners, service providers and investors. Offer an incentive to all participants to use the platform. Charge a service fee and share with platform users in the form of claimed rewards. 


In summary, the smart contracts provide a comprehensive framework for handling various aspects of RWA management on the blockchain, including valuation, inspection, insurance, and management services. The service providers are paid in REIT tokens, and these transactions are managed securely and transparently on the blockchain.
